This code implements a Deep Q-Learning agent to solve a maze environment. It uses PyTorch to create a convolutional neural network for Q-value estimation. The agent learns to navigate from start to goal using epsilon-greedy exploration and experience replay. The training progress is visualized, and a custom function demonstrates the trained agent's performance in the maze.
